## Prepare Data

```{r}
# Read in shapefile for the West Coast EEZ

```

```{r}
# Read in bathymetry raster

```

```{r}
# Read in SST rasters and combine SST rasters into raster stack

```

```{r}
# Check CRS' and transform to match

```

## Process data

```{r}
# Find the mean SST from 2008-2012 (e.g. create single raster of average SST)

```

```{r}
# Convert average SST from Kelvin to Celsius (hint: subtract by 273.15)

```

```{r}
# Crop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster

```

```{r}
# note: the resolutions of the SST and depth data do not match
# Resample the depth data to match the resolution of the SST data using the nearest neighbor approach

```

```{r}
# Check that the depth and SST match in resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system (hint: can the rasters be stacked?)

```

### Find suitable locations

```{r}
# reclassify SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for oysters (hint: set suitable values to 1 and unsuitable values to 0)

```

```{r}
# Find locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions
# HINT: The SST and depth rasters should now identify the suitability of locations as 0 or 1. To find locations that have both suitable temperature and depth, you can use map algebra. One idea is to multiple the values of the cells, using the lapp() function.


```

### Determine the most suitable EEZ

```{r}
# Select suitable cells within West Coast EEZs

```

```{r}
# Find area of grid cells

```

```{r}
# Find the total suitable area within each EEZ (hint: it might be helpful to rasterize the EEZ data)

```
